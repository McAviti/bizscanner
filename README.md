Make scanning great again: Tools for getting much out of a simple scanner - duplex, pdf

## Linux scripts

* *createpdfdoc.sh:* Scans all documents that are available to a scanner, applies OCR and links them into a single PDF.
* *createpdfdoc2.sh:* Same as before + simulates a duplex-scanner by first scanning odd pages and afterwards even ones
